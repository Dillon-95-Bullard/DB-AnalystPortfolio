Descriptive Data Mining Example:  Cluster Analysis
	Consider times it might be useful to assign individuals to two or more groupings
		Market segmentation for more efficient/effective advertising
		Product segmentation, grouping products with similar characteristics
		Developing employee teams for project management
		Identifying "similar" investment opportunities for portfolio building
	Recall that data mining is about letting the data build its own models
		Machine learning:
			Supervised -> data are fit to hypothesized models (e.g., regression)
			Unsupervised -> data guide the model building (e.g., clustering)
		Today, let's look at Cluster Analysis 
			References (see Getting Started module -> "Additional Resources"):

					Excel data file
					Python solution demo (PDF file)
						Print a hardcopy
						Work along with the discussion <<<**
				Purpose:  
					Identify students with similarities; assist with teammate selection
					Develop template for use with current student data
				Therefore, two phases:
					Analysis A -> clustering of old data; classSurvey2024d
					Analysis B -> clustering of current data; classSurvey2024b2
					Note:  Analysis A is for practice, and Analysis B is for grading
			Demonstration of Analysis A
				Open the data file and save it as a CSV file
				Store the CSV file in your jN home directory
				Open jN and start writing the code you see in the PDF file
				Pay attention to the discussion
					You are expected to learn how/why the code works  
					Therefore, take NOTES!
					Refer also to pyAnalyticsIntro2024b.txt (in "Additional Resources")
			If your jN script works correctly, save a copy as classSurvey2024b2
				Open that copy and rework as appropriate to complete the analysis
					of the current data.
				Submit that jN file in Canvas and use the results to assist you 
					in finding a teammate for future work.
